    XoGame Project Overview
========================================================================

XoGame application provides interface for XO game (or tic-tac-toe or (m,n)-game) in
 human vs. human, human vs. AI and AI vs. AI modes. AI uses neural net for move selection.
 Neural nets are trained using genetic algorithm (NOTE: TRAINING MODULE IS NOT IMPLEMENTED
 YET!), where successive generations of AI brains play full-round tournaments and the
 genetic recombination is based on the results via tournament selection.
 (Reinforcement Learning would be better method for sure, based on the
 performance shown by Google's AlphaGo program recently)

Notes:
 -- params.ini contains the parameters used by the neural net.
 -- Training module (new training) is not yet implemented. Presently, the random
    initialized untrained neural net AI doesn't perform any better than random
    number generator. 
 -- 'Eigen' linear algebra package is required to compile the project!

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Modules:

Main.cpp
	Main application source file
	
Game.cpp
	This module handles the xo-game instance

RenderGame.cpp
	This module renders the board and game position for Game-module.

AIBrain.cpp
	This module handles AI decision making using neural nertwork.
	The candidate move with highest ouput from neural network is chosen
	
	(Deep: All candidate moves are
	evaluated using the associated neural net and the one with highest
	output is selected.)

NeuralNet.cpp
	This module contains the methods for neural net calculations
	(forward propagation).

Training.cpp
	This module is the controller for training process using genetic algorithms,
	where successive generations of AI brains play full-round tournaments and the
	genetic recombination is based on the results via tournament selection.

Tournament.cpp
	This module handles the full-round tournament for AI brains.

GeneticAlgorithm.cpp
	This module contains the methods for genetic algorithm.

CParams.cpp
	Class to hold all the parameters used in this project. The values
	are loaded in from an ini file when an instance of the class is
	created.

utils.cpp
	This module contains some useful auxiliary functions.

Other files:	

XoGame.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

XoGame.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

XoGame.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

XoGame.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file XoGame.rc.

small.ico
    This is an icon file, which contains a smaller version (16x16)
    of the application's icon. This icon is included by the main resource
    file XoGame.rc.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named Circle2.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
